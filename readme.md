# Put Me On

The one stop shop for discovering new music and genres.

## What is Put Me On?

The original idea was borrowed from <https://developer.spotify.com/community/showcase/boil-frog/>. Basically we ask the user to enter two artists, a start and an end. Our algorithm determines the optimal route between the artists using song genres and collaborators and finds a path from one artist to another based on the discogrophy of other artists in between. It's a great way to be introduced to new artists and genres!
